# 🔐 Secure Chat App with End-to-End Encryption

A real-time, multi-client secure chat system built using Python sockets. Supports one-to-one, group, and broadcast messaging with AES-based end-to-end encryption—ensuring that **even the server cannot read your messages**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **End-to-End Encryption (AES-128)**  
  All messages are encrypted before leaving the client and decrypted only by the recipient.

- 👤 **Private Messaging**  
  One-to-one secure messaging between clients.

- 📢 **Broadcast & Selective Broadcast**  
  Send messages to all or a selected set of connected clients.

  - Group-based messaging with sender identification

- ✍️ **Typing Indicators**  
  Real-time typing notifications for individuals and group members.

- ⏱ **Message Editing**  
  Prompt to edit messages with a 20-second timeout before sending.

- 🛡 **Tamper Detection**  
  The server can simulate tampering with a 10% chance—clients will detect and reject modified messages.

- 📶 **Multi-Device Support**  
  Works across multiple devices on the same network via a centralized server.

- 📜 **Online Users Tracking**  
  See who is currently online.

- 📬 **Delivery Acknowledgements**  
  Clients are informed whether their message was successfully delivered or blocked.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-chat-app.git
cd secure-chat-app


### 2. Run the Server
Update HOST in server.py to your local IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x) and start the server:

# #python server.py

### 3. Run the Client(s)
On the same or different devices (connected to same network):  (for different devices use cnetral server ip of one of device and make sure each device is connected to same wifi)

## python client.py


## 🧪 Usage
Once connected, follow the command formats:

| Command           | Example                               |
